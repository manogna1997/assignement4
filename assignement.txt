Graphql
 - is a query language framework for CURD operation into a data source (inmemoey,mongodb,sql)
 - its was developed by facebook in 2011 to avoid multiple rest calls for fetching data from different sources.
 - some of the benefits that i observed
    - easy implementation of client and server interaction 
    - retrieving/add data can be exposed has REST API 
    - Strong declaration using types in schema
    - we can map relation in schemas and Graphql takes care of translating it into querries.
    - More Flexibility using resolver to handle request and data manipulation
- we learnt about Apollo server and client that expose Graphql has REST API and a client which React JS can use 
to interact with Graphql by events such has mutation and querry.
